# Background

Customer Segmentation is dividing customers based on common characteristics, such as demographics
or behavior. Customer Segmentation aids organizations/companies maximize the value
of each customer to the business. In this case study, customers will be segmented based on their
shopping behavior.
RFM is an acronym for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. RFM analysis is a datadriven
customer behavior segmentation technique that is based on when their last purchase was
(Recency), how often they have purchased in the past (Frequency), and how much they have
spent overall (Monetary Value). RFM analysis can help an organization optimize personalized
campaigns, improve conversion rates, and improve revenue and profits.
Unsupervised Machine Learning is a technique where Artificial Intelligence Algorithms learn
patterns without supervision. KMeans clustering is a form of unsupervised ML algorithm
that segments observations into a ‘k’ number of clusters that share similarities. In this context,
clustering will be carried out based on RFM segments.
Problem Statement & Objectives
Our retail store is set to launch 3 different campaigns in order to drive sales, and the C-suite executives
are requesting for an analysis dividing customers based on their interactions with company
products, services, and their monetary value to tailor campaigns to it’s intended audience.
Some of the objectives of this project include: - To have a thorough understanding of the dataset
by carrying out EDA. - To segment customers based on RFM scores. - To identify high-value
customers who have made recent and frequent purchases with high monetary value using RFM
Analysis. - To categorize customers into clusters to tailor campaigns using KMeans Clustering. -
To proffer recommendations based on the cluster analysis results.
